Looking over my work yesterday, I'm a little unhappy with the design. It's acceptable, especially for a first one, but I think I need more media and need to make it more lively. I'll forego putting a personal video of it up there, just because my camera quality is horrible, and my editing sucks. I don't want to scare people away. 

I also can't spend too long working on this. Again, the point of working on the landing page, the blog, and so on is to establish the basic overall framework of the project. It'll be using static site generation for those two specifically, so creating a streamline of it from flask or node is not going to be helpful. 

I'll be throwing it up on Google Cloud as well, see how that works. 

A thing I have to think about is account management. I've accrued many google accounts over the days, and I'll need to consolidate them eventually, preferably before Monalect is seriously put out there so I won't have to rely on account changing features with stupid usernames. Perhaps a better way is to create rather a central document noting the account names and emails of the various business sites. So long as I have the map, I wouldn't really have to rely on a new series of accounts. It's also a bit counter-intuitive to fix my mess of accounts with more accounts.

I'm unhappy with the design's visual scale. It's too large on my large monitor, but when I look at it on my laptop's smaller monitor, I find it just right.

I think I may cut some features as well. I find adding blog posts to be too much for now. The design works with just the minimum here.

So far I'm happy with it. I'll put up the minimum touches, and move on. It's pretty minimal, but I expect to improve it later on when I have some of the main product to show off.
