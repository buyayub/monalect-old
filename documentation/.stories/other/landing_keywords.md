### Keyword List for SEO

Audience: Self-directed Learners

#### Intent

+ Information Intent: information on a specific topic
+ Navigational Intent: access a specific website by entering the term in a search engine
+ Commercial Intent: to buy something sometime soon and are doing research before making a purchase
	+ 'buy' becomes 'freely use' in my case, it's still applicable
+ Transactional Intent: to buy something after doing commercial intent searches
 	+ again, replace 'buy' with 'freely use'

#### What this business is about

+ Self-directed learning
+ Self-learning... (List of possibilities, with focuses indicated
	+ STEM
		+ **Math**: a bit hard to accomodate, but can be made to work
		+ Physics
		+ Chemistry
		+ **Psychology**: a good choice because it's a popular point of pursuit and self-education
		+ Biology
		+ **Computer science:** a lot of people self-learn this as well
			+ the subject of 'programming' more specifically
	+ Humanities 
		+ Sociology
		+ **Philosophy:** another popular subject to self study, that can merge well with monalect
		+ Literature
		+ History
		+ Language
			+ Monalect isn't too suited for languages, but it *should* be. I think the market however is too saturated there. I'd benefit more from focusing on the other less-exploited subjects.
			+ Still a valuable learning resource, and inspiration.
